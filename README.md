# Objective: Interfacing MySQL Connector/C++ with the Qt Framework for Mysql Databases.
# Why? 

MySQL Connector/C++ is an object-oriented database API library to work with MySQL database and C++.The API is partly built upon the JDBC 4.0 API specification.         As a result, the C++ class names and functional interfaces are same as we use in JDBC programming in Java. 

MySQL already has a C-style native API library and the  problem is that, to fit it with the C++ paradigm, one has to manipulate using cryptic code.MySQL
Connector/C++, on the other hand, is purely object-oriented, backed by a well-designed architecture. On the C++ GUI framework, C++ has a variety of options for creating a cross-platform GUI interface. 

But, Qt is perhaps the best among them. The library is simple to implement and contains highly intuitive classes and functions to fit almost every need of the developer. This article is an attempt to couple these two techs and show how effectively they can be used to create a Qt C++ GUI interface for a MySQL Connector/C++ database application.

# Phases of our proposed work: 

Following tools to go hands-on with the following code.
The underlying platform used here is Linux. So, the configuration and settings will be shown based on the Linux platform only:
   1.MySQL Database
   2.MySQL Connector/C++
   3.Qt5 Framework with QtCreator

# Advantages

From a programmer's point of view, the key benefits of using MySQL Connector/C++ over native API library are as follows:

    The API is built to support a Object-Oriented paradigm; therefore, C-style function calls are not required.
    JDBC 4.0 is an industry standard specification; the MySQL Connector/C++ API is based on this architecture.
    The evolution of the API will be consistent with industry standards.
    The API is simple and intuitive.

The Qt C++ Framework needs no introduction. It is a masterpiece work pioneered by Haavard and Eirik. In its present form, Qt has developed a chain of toolkits to suffice almost every need of the developer and has become one of the most versatile frameworks in the C++ arena. It is an excellent framework for building cross-platform C++ applications; it can be ported to all major platforms available in the market. Apart from supporting many other languages, Qt is extensively used for embedded application development.

Hence here, we focus on going hands-on to create a MySQL database application with a Qt interface.That's all!!!
